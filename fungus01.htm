<P> Fungi, a large group of heterotrophic organisms that do not contain chlorophyll and can not carry out photosynthesis. There is no differentiation of root, stem and leaf, no photosynthetic pigment such as chlorophyll (except a few photosynthetic bacteria), and it can not carry out photosynthesis, saprophytic life or parasitic life, that is heterotrophic life. Most of the reproductive organs are single cell, and zygotes do not develop into embryos. </P>
