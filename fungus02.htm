<P> Fungi are a huge family. They are everywhere. At present, there are about 120000 species of fungi known. Fungi can be divided into bacteria, myxomycetes and fungi, which are not related to each other. Myxomycetes are between animals and fungi. In the vegetative stage, it is a naked, cell wall free, multinucleated protoplast mass, called metamorph (similar to amoeba). However, in the reproductive period, it can produce spores with cellulose cell wall and have the characteristics of fungi.</P>
